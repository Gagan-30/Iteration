# Iteration

Count-controlled Loops 

Program 1: Create a loop that runs ten times, outputting the value of the counter with each iteration. 

Program 2: Create a program that counts down from 100 to 1 

Program 3: Create a count-up loop that counts in 2s. 

Program 4: modify the previous loop so that it counts up to a number inputted by the user. (Use the Scanner.) 

Example 

Enter the end value: 

> 8 

Result: 0, 2, 4, 6 

 

Program 5: Create a program that will allow the user to enter an integer. It will then iterate until the counter is equal to the value of the inputted integer. With each iteration add the value of the counter to the original integer and output the result. 

Example 

Enter the end value: 

> 5 

Result: 15 

 

Program 6: Allow the user to specify what number (a) they want to see a times table (up to 12x) for. Present the output in the format  “1 x a =”. 

Example 

Enter the required table: 

> 5 

1 x 5 = 5 

2 x 5 = 10 

3 x 5 = 15 

… 

12 x 5 = 60 

 

Program 7: Create a program that allows the user to enter 5 real numbers. At each prompt it should say “Please enter number x” where x is the number of the current iteration. It must calculate and output the average. 

 
Example 

Enter the 1st number: 

> 5.3 

Enter the 2nd number: 

> 6.21 

… 

The average is 7.29. 

 Condition controlled problems  

Pre-Condition 

 

Program 8: Create a countdown for take-off using the following pseudocode: 

while(n >0){ 

print(n) 

n=n-1 

} 

print (“We have Lift off”) 

 

Program 9: Create a logarithm table for values of x between 0. and 20. Use the pseudocode below to help you 

while ( INSERT CONDITION ){ 

print(x + “ “ + Math.log(x)) 

x=x+1 

} 

 

Program 10: Ask the user to enter an integer. If the integer is even then divide by 2 until a result of 1 is reached. At each stage show the calculation being performed. If the integer is uneven then output a message notifying the user. 

 

Program 11: Allow the user to enter two integers. Display all the whole numbers between the two. 

 

Post-condition 

 

Program 12: Rewrite program 1 so that it uses a post condition loop. Use the pseudocode below to help you: 

 

do{ 

print(n) 

n=n-1 

} while(n >1) 

print (“We have Lift off”) 

 

Program 13: Rewrite program 2 using post-condition iteration. 

 

Program 14: Create a program that allows the user to enter a name. It must say “Howdy” to each name until the user enters quit. 

 

Program 15: Create a program that lets the user enter an alphanumeric password. If the password is wrong they are notified and prompted to re-enter. If it is correct then a confirmation is displayed. Store a string constant with the password within the program. Extend this program so the user is only given three tries, after the third attempt a “locked-out” message is displayed. 

 

Program 16: Create a guess the number game. Ask player 1 to enter a number between 1 and 100. Player 2 has to then guess the number; they have unlimited tries. Once this works build in guidance so that player 2 is given hints if the number is too high or too low. 

 

Program 17: A nightclub wants to count the number of goths and k-pop fans entering the premises each night by entering a g or k into the system. They want to end their count for the night by entering x. Display the end figures.
